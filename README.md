Classic Arcade Game Clone

for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

This project recreates a classic game Frogger using HTML5 Canvas and Object-oriented Javascript.

HOW to play:

The goal of the game is to collect as many Gems (points), as possible, while avoiding bugs and stay away from the water (You'll drown!) Player gets 3 lives and just 60 seconds to score as many points as possible. Player can move up and down, left and right (use the keyboard to navigate). 
Can you get more than 8000 points before time runs out? The game is over when the time runs out or you lose your 3 lives (bugs are dangerous and stay away from the water).
To play again, simply click button "start game" on screen.
